## Project Overview

We decided to take on a project idea, which is intended to solve an issue regarding housing and practical experience for college students who plan to enter the medical field. In addition, this would also solve the issue for older adults, who wish to age-in-place, or maintain some independence by continuing to live in their own home. The idea is to give students in the college of Health and Human sciences the chance to live with an older adult rent free in exchange for trips to doctor's appointments, help with mobility, medications, and general activities of daily living. The Silver Nest Server is a database which enables our application to house data specific to an older adult who wishes to be involved with this program. From here, data is displayed in the app for students to find an older adult with needs they feel most suited to assist with.

## Challenges
* Learning backend fundamentals such as migrating and seeding
* Hosting our server on heroku
* Familiarizing ourselves with the Heroku and Knex CLI
* Using React with hooks for the first time
* Dificulty testing profile for getting the resident prop into render method

## Wins
* Successfully developing and debloying a backend for our site
* Implementing successful study techniques to efficiently build our project within a 7 day window
* Successully using material-ui for the build and styles of our UI
* Passing and manipulating data to suit the needs of user interaction

## Roadmap
With more time, we would like to enhance the UI/UX by:
* Adding a view for the home owner
* User authentication
* Enable a chat between prospective students and residents
* Updating the data base to show that a resident is no longer available
