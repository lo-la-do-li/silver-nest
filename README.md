## Challenges
* Migrating and seeding
* Learning backend fundamentals
* Hosting server on heroku
* Using React with hoods for the first time
* Dificulty testing profile for getting the resident prop into render method

## Wins
* Successfully developing and debloying a backend for our site
* Implementing successful study techniques to efficiently build our project within a 7 day window
* Successully using material-ui for the build and styles of our UI
* Passing and manipulating data to suit 

## Roadmap
* With more time, we would like to enhance the UI/UX by:
* Adding a view for the home owner
* User authentication
* Enable a chat between prospective students and residents
* Updating the data base to show that a resident is no longer available
